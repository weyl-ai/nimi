It turns a NixOS modular services configuration into a reliable, lightweight runtime that starts services, streams logs, and applies predictable restart and startup behavior. Why Modular services are composable Nix modules: you can import a service, override options, and instantiate it multiple times with different settings. is the runtime that brings those modules to life outside a full init system (i.e. ). If you are new to modular services, the upstream explanation is the best place to start: NixOS Modular Services Manual . What's in the box A small PID 1 style runtime suitable for containers. Clean process execution with structured startup and shutdown flow. Configurable restart behavior for resilient services. One-time startup hook for quick initialization steps. Clear, instance-per-service configuration using modular services. Usage Define services using modular service modules. Evaluate the config with to produce JSON. Run with the generated config to launch and supervise services. Quick-start Minimal Nix configuration: Run the generated config: Configuration highlights : declare named service instances by importing modular service modules and overriding options per instance. : choose , , or , and tune delay and retry count. : optionally run one binary before services start.
