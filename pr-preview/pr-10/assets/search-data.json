This is the main safety net for keeping long-running services alive, and also a guardrail to prevent tight restart loops from burning CPU. You can choose a policy that matches the reliability needs of each deployment. For development you might disable restarts entirely, while production workloads usually benefit from a bounded or always-on policy.","path":"options.html#option-settings-restart","tokens":["each","always-on","control","exit","the","net","long-running","alive","for","loops","prevent","this","burning","can","matches","restarted","development","while","benefit","after","manager","how","entirely","deployment","workloads","disable","needs","cpu","and","services","restart","process","are","tight","also","from","reliability","usually","bounded","you","safety","choose","main","that","nimi","production","policy","use","guardrail","keeping","might","restarts","they"],"title_tokens":["settings","restart","option"],"anchors":[]},{"id":"40","title":"Option: settings.restart.count","content":"Maximum number of restart attempts when is .
