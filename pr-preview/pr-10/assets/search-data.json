This is the main safety net for keeping long-running services alive, and also a guardrail to prevent tight restart loops from burning CPU. You can choose a policy that matches the reliability needs of each deployment. For development you might disable restarts entirely, while production workloads usually benefit from a bounded or always-on policy.","path":"options.html#option-settings-restart","tokens":["while","guardrail","net","you","for","policy","can","are","keeping","services","restarted","nimi","needs","might","use","after","also","loops","cpu","matches","each","tight","prevent","exit","restarts","long-running","production","bounded","workloads","always-on","burning","that","manager","and","disable","entirely","benefit","how","restart","safety","process","main","usually","development","this","from","control","the","reliability","deployment","they","alive","choose"],"title_tokens":["restart","option","settings"],"anchors":[]},{"id":"40","title":"Option: settings.restart.count","content":"Maximum number of restart attempts when is .
