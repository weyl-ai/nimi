This is the main safety net for keeping long-running services alive, and also a guardrail to prevent tight restart loops from burning CPU. You can choose a policy that matches the reliability needs of each deployment. For development you might disable restarts entirely, while production workloads usually benefit from a bounded or always-on policy.","path":"options.html#option-settings-restart","tokens":["after","nimi","services","burning","deployment","usually","production","bounded","workloads","cpu","can","guardrail","reliability","keeping","they","safety","are","disable","prevent","while","exit","manager","tight","net","use","restarted","process","control","for","loops","restarts","choose","from","also","benefit","you","this","restart","development","how","main","might","policy","that","needs","entirely","always-on","long-running","alive","and","matches","each","the"],"title_tokens":["option","restart","settings"],"anchors":[]},{"id":"40","title":"Option: settings.restart.count","content":"Maximum number of restart attempts when is .
